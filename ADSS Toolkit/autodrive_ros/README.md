# ROS Package

<p align="justify">
This directory hosts the <code>autodrive</code> ROS package, which supports modular algorithm development targetted towards autonomous driving. It uses client libraries for Python and C++, and can be therefore exploited by the users to develop their algorithms flexibly.

## DEPENDENCIES

[AutoDRIVE Devkit's Python API](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Devkit/ADSS%20Toolkit/autodrive_py) has the following dependencies (tested with Python 3.8.10):

- Websocket-related dependencies for communication bridge between [AutoDRIVE Simulator](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Simulator) and [AutoDRIVE Devkit](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Devkit) (version sensitive):
  | Package | Tested Version |
  |---------|----------------|
  | eventlet | 0.33.3 |
  | Flask | 1.1.1 |
  | Flask-SocketIO | 4.1.0 |
  | python-socketio | 4.2.0 |
  | python-engineio | 3.13.0 |
  | greenlet | 1.0.0 |
  | gevent | 21.1.2 |
  | gevent-websocket | 0.10.1 |
  
  ```bash
  $ pip3 install eventlet==0.33.3
  $ pip3 install Flask==1.1.1
  $ pip3 install Flask-SocketIO==4.1.0
  $ pip3 install python-socketio==4.2.0
  $ pip3 install python-engineio==3.13.0
  $ pip3 install greenlet==1.0.0
  $ pip3 install gevent==21.1.2
  $ pip3 install gevent-websocket==0.10.1
  ```

- Generic dependencies for data processing and visualization (usually any version will do the job):

  | Package | Tested Version |
  |---------|----------------|
  | attrdict | 2.0.1 |
  | numpy | 1.13.3 |
  | pillow | 5.1.0 |
  | opencv-contrib-python | 4.5.1.48 |

  ```bash
  $ pip3 install attrdict
  $ pip3 install numpy
  $ pip3 install pillow
  $ pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
  ```

## SETUP

1. Clone `AutoDRIVE-Devkit` branch of the `AutoDRIVE` repository.
    ```bash
    $ git clone --single-branch --branch AutoDRIVE-Devkit https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE.git
    ```
2. Move the `autodrive` ROS package to the source space (`src`) of your catkin workspace.
    ```bash
    $ mv ~/AutoDRIVE-Devkit/autodrive_ros/autodrive ~/catkin_ws/src/
    ```
3. Build the package.
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/catkin_ws
    $ catkin_make
    ```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Upon execution of any launch file, if you encounter an error saying "Make sure file exists in package path and permission is set to executable (chmod +x)", set the executable flag on the process for all scripts and executables by running `chmod` on the entire workspace directory (won't hurt if it's already set)

```bash
$ cd <path/to/AutoDRIVE/Workspace>
$ sudo chmod +x -R *
```
